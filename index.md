## Data Encryption Standard Algorithm

### About this project:

The Data Encryption Standard algorithm is a method for encrypting and decrypting data. It was once widely used to protect data, but has since been replaced with the more complex Advanced Encyrption Standard algorithm. Click [here](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/teaching/hess/krypto-ws2006/des.htm) to learn more about the Data Encyrption Standard algorithm, This code was written in System Verilog to be uploaded to a Xilinx FPGA as a lab for [Dr. Stine's](https://experts.okstate.edu/james.stine) Digital Logic Design class at [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu/). Go Pokes!
